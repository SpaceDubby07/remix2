        description="The Siberian Husky's compact body, well-furred coat, erect
        ears, and thick, sickle-shaped tail immediately suggest the
        breed's northern heritage. The breed's ancestors were
        originally bred in northeastern Asia by the Chukchi people and
        were kept as companion dogs for their families as well as
        endurance sled dogs. When changing climate conditions forced
        the semi-nomadic Chukchi to expand their hunting grounds or
        perish, they rose to the challenge by developing a sled dog
        capable of hauling light loads over vast expanses of frozen
        wasteland in sub-zero temperatures, with a minimum expenditure
        of energy. The Chukchi, isolated by from the rest of the
        world, were able to maintain the purity of their sled teams
        for many generations. The dogs they developed were the direct
        forerunners of today's Siberian Husky. Siberians caught the
        eye of the public when they began winning sled races in the
        early 1900s, but they made headlines in 1925 when a legendary
        musher Leonhard Seppala led a relay of Siberian Huskies 658
        miles in only five and half days to rush a lifesaving serum to
        Nome, Alaska, where an epidemic of diphtheria had broken out.
        The thrilling 'serum run,' reported breathlessly in newspapers
        around the world, won Sibes a popularity that has not abated
        to this day. Balto, who was Seppala's lead dog on the final
        leg of the journey, remains one of the most honored hero dogs
        in canine history. Mushers still keep packs of sledding
        Siberians for fun and sport throughout North America. Less
        adventurous devotees of the breed simply enjoy the company of
        this sociable, gentle companion."
